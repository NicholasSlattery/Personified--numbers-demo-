# Personified (numbers demo)
Personified (Numbers Demo) is a fast, two player party-style guessing game in the browser. One player secretly "is" a random number, and the other has to figure it out by asking human-style questions, not just "is it 7." Includes an animated number "slot machine," built-in timer, round tracking, and an accessible UI that works on desktop and mobile.
